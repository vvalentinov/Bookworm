## üìñ Documentation

**Admin Area**:

Area for displaying administrator related logic. Here the admin can approve/unapprove/delete books/quotes and also manage the users, for example assigning roles.

**Account Area**:

Area for displaying account related logic. Here the user can change their username/password/email.

**Pagination:**

Bookworm supports pagination to efficiently handle large collections of books and quotes. Instead of displaying all books/quotes at once, the collection is divided into pages, allowing you to navigate with ease.

***Guest user:***
- Can only browse through quotes without liking/uploading, etc.
- Can only browse through books without downloading/rating/uploading/commenting/addingToFavorites, etc.

***Logged-in user:***

- Can upload quote
- Can download book
- Can search for quotes
- Can comment on book
- Can receive notifications
- Can rate someone else's books
- Can delete and edit own books
- Can like someone else's quote
- Can delete and edit own quotes

***Administrator***:

- Can assign role to users
- Can delete comments of all users
- Can approve/unapprove/delete books and quotes

***Book Download***:

User can download a specific number of books a day. That number is calculated based on the user points. Every time a user book or quote is approved, that user gains points. For approved book is 5 points and for approved quote is 2 points. The opposite is also true - when an administrator unapproves a user book/quote, that user loses points.

Number of max daily downloads count based on points:

- Points < 100 -> 10 books
- Points >= 100 and < 200 -> 15 books
- Points >= 200 and < 300 -> 20 books
- Points >= 300 and < 400 -> 25 books
- Points >= 400 -> 30 books

That limitation does not apply for an administrator.

***Book Rating:***

A user can rate a book by giving it a number of stars ‚≠ê, between one and five. The book's average rating is calculated and displayed on the details page.

***Book Upload***:

Uploaded books and images are being uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.
The book file, representing the book itself, can only be in *.pdf* format and the book image, representing the book cover, can only be in *.jpg*, *.jpeg*, *.png* format. The book's *.pdf* file can have a size of max *15 mb* and the book's image file can have a size of max *5 mb*.

***Scheduling jobs***

There are two backgroung jobs implemented using the Quartz.NET library.

- ResetDailyDownloadsCountJob - this job updates the database by setting the DailyDownloadsCount property of a user to be equal to zero. It's being executed every day at midnight.
- MarkOldNotificationsAsDeletedJob - this job marks old notifications as deleted in the database. It checks for old notifications every 10 minutes and if it finds such - it sets IsDelete to be true. Old notifications are those which are older than 3 days.

***Quote Upload***:

The user can choose from three different types of quotes to upload - movie, book or general quote. When the uploaded quote is approved by admin it becomes visible for everyone and the user gains 2 points.

***Quote Like***:

The user cannot like his/her own quotes, but can like someone else's quote.
